/*
Package sarama provides client libraries for the Kafka 0.8 protocol.

Package sarama is a dummy package, you almost certainly want sarama/kafka instead, which contains the high-level userspace API.

If not, sarama/protocol contains the low-level API that gives you exact control over what goes on the wire.
